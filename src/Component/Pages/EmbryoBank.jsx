        The world is a different place today than that in which our mothers and
        grandmothers lived. Many of today's modern couples choose to start a
        family later in life. Embryo Banking allows these couples the chance to
        freeze embryos and delay starting their families until the time is
        right. Also, during the IVF process many couples naturally produce an
        embryo surplus. Freezing surplus embryos until future cycles can
        circumvent additional egg retrievals. And last, for singles & couples
        with little time left on their fertility clock, Embryo Banking is an
        ideal strategy and gives the best insurance for starting a family later,
        especially if they want more than one child.
