      <p>
        We maintain a dedicated Semen Bank. We have one of the best Semen Bank
        in India. The male partners sperms are routinely frozen for cryopooling
        and for IVF, or prior to treatment of cancer or any major surgery. We
        screen all donors for HIV HbsAg VDRL every three months. Carefully look
        into any family history of diabetes, hypertension, congenital anomalies
        and blood disorders. Donors physical characteristics are matched with
        the recipient in terms of height, physique, colour of skin/eyes/hair,
        texture of hair, caste religion, IQ, Blood Group, General/Financial
        Status in society. Donors are recruited only when they meet our
        requirements and are continued if their fertility status is proved. We
        ensure close confidentiality for both the donor and the recipient.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have latest instruments for transportation of washed semen samples in
        “Lab condition” (i.e. 37°C and 5% Co2) to else where. Donor’s / Male
        Partner's processed Semen sample is available to outside consultants on
        request.
