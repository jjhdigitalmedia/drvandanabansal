      Vaginal Sonography, which is a base line scan. An ultrasound scan is carried out to check the ovaries and the endometrial lining. In addition, fibroids in the uterus and cysts in the ovaries can be diagnosed. When scan is done several times during ovulation phase it is called Follicular monitoring â€“ to visualize the development of follicles (each follicle has within itself an egg) and the lining of the uterus.

        An instrument to move the uterus during surgery will be placed in the
        vagina. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is put into the abdomen through a special
        needle that is inserted just below the navel. This gas helps to separate
        the organs inside the abdominal cavity, making it easier for the
        physician to see the reproductive organs during laparoscopy. The gas is
        removed at the end of the procedure.

        Microlaparoscopy a new minimally invasive diagnostic surgical procedure
        uses telescopes and instruments that are much smaller than normal. If
        this procedure is appropriate for your condition, smaller incisions will
        be made and postoperative abdominal tenderness may be reduced.

        This procedure involves inserting a small telescope known as a
        laparoscope through the abdominal wall when the pelvic organs can be
        clearly seen. A laparoscopy is performed in the operating theatre,
        usually as a day-case under a general anaesthetic. Laparoscopy is
        performed to inspect the uterus, tubes and ovaries for the presence of
        adhesions. Other pelvic problems such as Hydrosalpinx, Pelvic TB,
        Endometriosis and Fibroid can also be detected.
