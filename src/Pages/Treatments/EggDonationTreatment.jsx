        Egg donation is the process by which a woman provides one or several
        (usually 10-15) eggs (ova, oocytes) for purposes of assisted
        reproduction or biomedical research. For assisted reproduction purposes,
        egg donation involves the process of in vitro fertilization as the eggs
        are fertilized in the laboratory. Egg donation is part of the process of
        third party reproduction as part of ART (Assisted Reproductive
        Technology).

        All the steps are IVF are performed except the egg donor undergoes the
        ovulation induction and egg retrieval. Once the eggs are retrieved ,
        they are Fertilized with the partner’s sperms. Legal, medical and Psycho
        logic counseling are required.
