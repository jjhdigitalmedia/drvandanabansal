      <p>
        A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is an X-ray test that looks at the inside of
        the uterus and fallopian tubes and the area around them. It often is
        done for women who are having a hard time becoming pregnant (infertile).
      </p>
      <p>
        During a hysterosalpingogram, a dye (contrast material) is put through a
        thin tube that is put through the vagina and into the uterus. Because
        the uterus and the fallopian tubes are hooked together, the dye will
        flow into the fallopian tubes. Pictures are taken using a steady beam of
        X-ray (fluoroscopy) as the dye passes through the uterus and fallopian
        tubes. The pictures can show problems such as an injury or abnormal
        structure of the uterus or fallopian tubes, or a blockage that would
        prevent an egg moving through a fallopian tube to the uterus. A blockage
        also could prevent sperm from moving into a fallopian tube and joining
        (fertilizing) an egg. A hysterosalpingogram also may find problems on
        the inside of the uterus that prevent a fertilized egg from attaching
        (implanting) to the uterine wall. See a picture of a
        hysterosalpingogramcamera.
        <h1>Why It Is Done</h1>
        <p>A hysterosalpingogram is done to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Find a blocked fallopian tube. The test often is done for a woman
            who is having a hard time becoming pregnant. An infection may cause
            severe scarring of the fallopian tubes and block the tubes,
            preventing pregnancy. Occasionally the dye used during a
            hysterosalpingogram will push through and open a blocked tube.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find problems in the uterus, such as an abnormal shape or structure,
            an injury, polyps, fibroids, adhesions, or a foreign object in the
            uterus. These types of problems may cause painful menstrual periods
            or repeated miscarriages.
          </li>
          <li>
            See whether surgery to reverse a tubal ligation has been successful.

      <h1>Sonosalpingography</h1>
      <p>
        In this, the tubes patency is assessed by ultrasound by pushing a fluid
        through the uterus into the tubes. It is not only as accurate as HSG but
        has the advantage of the women not being exposed to radiation and also
        of assessing the uterine cavity and ovaries at the same time.in our
        experience 95% of pts opt for this saline infusion sonographySaline
        infusion sonography or Sonohysterography is a specialized procedure by
        which fluid, usually sterile saline, is installed into the uterine
        cavity, and gynecologic sonography performed at the same time. The
        procedure delineates intrauterine pathology such as polyps, Asherman's
        syndrome, uterine malformations or submucous leiomyoma.

      <p>
        A Hysterosalpingogram HSG is a x-ray procedure / Sonosalpingography is
        an ultrasound procedure, may also be used to check whether or not the
        Fallopian tubes are blocked. This is involving the injection of a
        special dye through the cervix and into the uterus.
