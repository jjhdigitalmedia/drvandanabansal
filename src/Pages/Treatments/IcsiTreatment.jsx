        ICSI Treatment for Male Infertility
      </h1>
      <p className="my-3">
        ICSI is indicated when few sperms are available or no sperms are
        available or IVF is not possible or unexplained fertilization failure or
        low fertilization in previous IVF cycles. Total azoospermia (total
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate) can be due either to a blockage,
        absence of the vas deferens or to a failure of the testes to produce
        spermatozoa. The degree of this failure can be variable. 90% of patients
        with azoospermia can be benefited by ICSI after confirming the presence
        of sperms in the testicular biopsy. However, the sperm that is collected
        is not able to fertilize the egg in the natural way and ICSI is always
        necessary. This leads to a fertilization rate of around 85% Sperm can be
        recovered either by open surgery needle or aspiration. During
        Microepididymal Sperm Aspiration (MESA) - the scrotum is opened and
        under microscope sperm is aspirated from the epididymis. Percutaneous
        Sperm Aspiration (PESA) is a less invasive technique whereby a small
        needle is inserted through the skin directly into the epididymis to
        aspirate sperm.

        <li>
          1. Ovarian Stimulation: Similar to traditional in vitro fertilization
          (IVF), the woman undergoes hormonal therapy to stimulate the ovaries
          to produce multiple eggs. This is typically achieved through the use
          of injectable fertility medications.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Egg Retrieval: Once the eggs have matured, they are retrieved from
          the woman's ovaries using transvaginal ultrasound aspiration, a minor
          surgical procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Sperm Collection: On the same day as the egg retrieval, the male
          partner provides a sperm sample, or sperm may be obtained via other
          means such as testicular biopsy or from a sperm donor.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Sperm Injection: Using a specialized microscope and
          micromanipulation equipment, a single healthy sperm is selected and
          injected directly into the cytoplasm (interior) of each mature egg.
          This is done using a thin glass needle, which is carefully inserted
          through the egg's outer membrane.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. Embryo Culture: After the eggs have been fertilized via ICSI, they
          are cultured in the laboratory for several days to allow the embryos
          to develop and grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          6. Embryo Transfer: Typically, one or more of the healthiest embryos
          are selected for transfer into the woman's uterus. This is done using
          a thin catheter, guided by ultrasound, which is inserted through the
          cervix and into the uterus to place the embryos in the optimal
          location.
        </li>
        <li>
          7. Luteal Phase Support: Following embryo transfer, the woman may be
          prescribed medications such as progesterone to support the uterine
          lining and improve the chances of successful implantation.
        </li>
        <li>
          8. Pregnancy Test: About two weeks after the embryo transfer, a
          pregnancy test is performed to determine if implantation has occurred
          and if the ICSI cycle was successful.
        </li>
      </ul>

        ICSI is particularly beneficial for couples dealing with male factor
        infertility, such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal
        sperm morphology. It can also be used in cases where traditional IVF has
        failed to achieve fertilization or when there are concerns about the
        ability of the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer membrane. Overall,
        ICSI has helped many couples achieve successful pregnancies and overcome
        fertility challenges.
