        Simply put, Endocrinology or Endocrine Profile is the study of endocrine
        glands. Endocrine glands are a group of glands in the body which secrete
        hormones. The purpose of the secreted hormones is to evoke a specific
        response in other cells of the body which are located far away. We
        utilize very specialized lab tests to help pinpoint the underlying cause
        of your health problem.
