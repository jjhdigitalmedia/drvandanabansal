        <p className="my-8">
          In vitro fertilization (IVF) with embryo transfer (ET) is a widely used
          assisted reproductive technology (ART) for couples struggling with
          infertility. Here's a breakdown of the IVF-ET process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li type="1">
            Ovarian Stimulation: The woman undergoes hormonal therapy to stimulate
            the ovaries to produce multiple eggs rather than the single egg that
            typically matures each month. This is done using injectable fertility
            medications, and the process is closely monitored with ultrasounds and
            blood tests.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Egg Retrieval: Once the eggs have matured, they are retrieved from the
            woman's ovaries using a minor surgical procedure called transvaginal
            ultrasound aspiration. A thin needle is guided through the vaginal
            wall to access the ovaries and retrieve the eggs.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Sperm Collection and Preparation: On the same day as the egg
            retrieval, the male partner provides a sperm sample, which is
            processed and prepared in the lab to isolate the healthiest and most
            motile sperm.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Fertilization: The prepared sperm is then combined with the retrieved
            eggs in the lab, either through traditional IVF (where the sperm is
            added to a dish containing the eggs) or through intracytoplasmic sperm
            injection (ICSI), where a single sperm is injected directly into each
            mature egg.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Embryo Culture: The fertilized eggs, now embryos, are cultured in the
            laboratory for a few days to allow them to develop and grow.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Embryo Transfer: Typically, one or more of the healthiest embryos are
            selected for transfer into the woman's uterus. This is done using a
            thin catheter, guided by ultrasound, which is inserted through the
            cervix and into the uterus to place the embryos in the optimal
            location.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Luteal Phase Support: Following embryo transfer, the woman may be
            prescribed medications such as progesterone to support the uterine
            lining and improve the chances of successful implantation.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Pregnancy Test: About two weeks after the embryo transfer, a pregnancy
            test is performed to determine if implantation has occurred and if the
            IVF cycle was successful.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          IVF-ET offers hope to many couples facing infertility, but success rates
          can vary depending on factors such as the woman's age, the quality of
          the embryos, and any underlying fertility issues. Multiple IVF cycles
          may be required to achieve a successful pregnancy.
