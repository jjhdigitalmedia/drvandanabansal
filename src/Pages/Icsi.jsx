        ICSI is indicated when few sperms are available or no sperms are available or IVF is not possible or unexplained fertilization failure or low fertilization in previous IVF cycles. Total azoospermia (total absence of sperm in the ejaculate) can be due either to a blockage, absence of the vas deferens or to a failure of the testes to produce spermatozoa. The degree of this failure can be variable. 90% of patients with azoospermia can be benefited by ICSI after confirming the presence of sperms in the testicular biopsy. However, the sperm that is collected is not able to fertilize the egg in the natural way and ICSI is always necessary. This leads to a fertilization rate of around 85% Sperm can be recovered either by open surgery needle or aspiration. During Microepididymal Sperm Aspiration (MESA) - the scrotum is opened and under microscope sperm is aspirated from the epididymis. Percutaneous Sperm Aspiration (PESA) is a less invasive technique whereby a small needle is inserted through the skin directly into the epididymis to aspirate sperm.

        <li>1.	Ovarian Stimulation: Similar to traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF), the woman undergoes hormonal therapy to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. This is typically achieved through the use of injectable fertility medications.</li>
        <li>2.	Egg Retrieval: Once the eggs have matured, they are retrieved from the woman's ovaries using transvaginal ultrasound aspiration, a minor surgical procedure.</li>
        <li>3.	Sperm Collection: On the same day as the egg retrieval, the male partner provides a sperm sample, or sperm may be obtained via other means such as testicular biopsy or from a sperm donor.</li>
        <li>4.	Sperm Injection: Using a specialized microscope and micromanipulation equipment, a single healthy sperm is selected and injected directly into the cytoplasm (interior) of each mature egg. This is done using a thin glass needle, which is carefully inserted through the egg's outer membrane.</li>
        <li>5.	Embryo Culture: After the eggs have been fertilized via ICSI, they are cultured in the laboratory for several days to allow the embryos to develop and grow.</li>
        <li>6.	Embryo Transfer: Typically, one or more of the healthiest embryos are selected for transfer into the woman's uterus. This is done using a thin catheter, guided by ultrasound, which is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus to place the embryos in the optimal location.</li>
        <li>7.	Luteal Phase Support: Following embryo transfer, the woman may be prescribed medications such as progesterone to support the uterine lining and improve the chances of successful implantation.</li>
        <li>8.	Pregnancy Test: About two weeks after the embryo transfer, a pregnancy test is performed to determine if implantation has occurred and if the ICSI cycle was successful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-3' >ICSI is particularly beneficial for couples dealing with male factor infertility, such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal sperm morphology. It can also be used in cases where traditional IVF has failed to achieve fertilization or when there are concerns about the ability of the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer membrane. Overall, ICSI has helped many couples achieve successful pregnancies and overcome fertility challenges.</p>
