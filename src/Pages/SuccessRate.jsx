            Several factors influence the success rate of in vitro fertilization
            (IVF) treatment. These factors include:
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">1. Age: </span> Age is one of the most significant factors
            affecting IVF success. Generally, the younger the woman, the higher
            the chances of success, as fertility declines with age.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">2. Cause of Infertility: </span> The underlying cause of infertility, whether it's related to issues with the woman's reproductive system, the man's reproductive system, or both, can impact IVF success rates.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">3. Ovarian Reserve: </span>  The quality and quantity of a woman's eggs, known as ovarian reserve, can affect the success of IVF. Women with a higher ovarian reserve typically have better outcomes.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">4. Response to Ovarian Stimulation:</span> The woman's response to ovarian stimulation medications, which are used to induce the development of multiple eggs, can influence IVF success. A poor response may result in fewer eggs retrieved, affecting the chances of success.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">5. Semen Quality: </span> The quality of the man's sperm, including parameters such as sperm count, motility, and morphology, plays a crucial role in IVF success. Poor semen quality can decrease the chances of fertilization and embryo development.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">1. Age: </span> Age is one of the most significant factors
            affecting IVF success. Generally, the younger the woman, the higher
            the chances of success, as fertility declines with age.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">6. Embryo Quality: </span> The quality of embryos transferred during IVF, as determined by their morphology and developmental stage, is a significant predictor of success. Higher-quality embryos have a better chance of implanting and resulting in a successful pregnancy.

          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold"> 7.	Previous IVF Attempts:</span> The number of previous IVF attempts can impact success rates. Women who have undergone multiple unsuccessful cycles may have lower chances of success in subsequent attempts.
          </div>
          <div className='text-justify' >
            <span className="font-semibold">8.	Lifestyle Factors: </span>  Certain lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and stress, can affect IVF success rates. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits may improve outcomes.

            <span className="font-semibold">9.	Reproductive Health Conditions:  </span> 9.	Reproductive Health Conditions: Pre-existing reproductive health conditions, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and uterine abnormalities, can affect IVF success rates.
